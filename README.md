# randomcolorgenerator
A React app that generates a random color and rgb values at the click of a button.

## Description
- My randomcolorgenerator was build with React.js to render a random color on the screen.
- You can change the color as much as you'd like by clicking the "Refresh" button. The rgb number is provided in case the user wants to use the color for their own project.
- I created this project to practice setting state and passing props through components in React.js.
